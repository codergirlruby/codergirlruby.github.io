  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently had an interview with HackReactor and I have to say it was very disappointing. I sat down with a &ldquo;resident&rdquo; to do a paired programming code challange and his communication wasn&rsquo;t very clear. He was very awkward and stilted in his speech.</p>

<p>The challange took longer than it should have but I really don&rsquo;t believe it to completely be my lack of experience. I expressed this to HackReactor in an E-mail and I received the expected PR wall of text.</p>

<p>In retrospect I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t waste my time and money attending HackReactor. I don&rsquo;t think any of these bootcamps can deliver what they promise and aren&rsquo;t for real hackers. If you go to the HackReactor website and look at the students who did get jobs,  its all from small start ups or non impressive companies. No one works for Twitter, Instagram, FB, Google, Mozilla, or any of  the brag worthy sites.</p>

<p>Also a lot of the students end up working for these bootcamps they attend which leads me to believe they are not getting job offers. Another reason I think they are not getting job offers is because the guy who was interviewing me is apart of the residency program. He was very excited about this because as he put it &ldquo;Now I can add more projects to my portfolio&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Two things popped into my head when he said this. One was, what? Can this guy not build his own project? The second thing was, I thought HackReactor was suppose to get you job ready, why does he need to come back to build his portfolio? This guys JavaScript syntax may be flawless but, he certainly cannot build anything without help from HackReactor. Why join the last 6 weeks of the program (the work on your own project part)  of the current cohort to do something you can do by yourself. He obviously doesn&rsquo;t have the motivation and/or technical skill.</p>

<p> He also kinda changed the subject quickly when I asked which companies come to look at the students. He said Microsoft (and didn&rsquo;t mention anymore) then kinda trailed off.  No one went to HackReactor and got a job at Microsoft because of it.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure Hack Reactor would promote that like a MoFo. I  also definatly do not want to attend some &ldquo;school&rdquo; where I am learning from a student who has no field experience.</p>

<p>I think  the best thing I can do for myself is to set myself apart from these bootcamp going folk by not only learning JS and other forgiving languages but to also learn low level languages such as C++. The old school way of contributing to open source projects, forums and developing web/phone apps on my own seems to be the best way. It shows initiative and genuine interest.</p>

<p>Pros of bootcamps:
brings you up to speed if you already have some experience.
You can buy your way into a network.
Full imersion.
Good to get out of the house I guess.</p>

<p>Cons of bootcamps:
You get conned out of a lot of money to &ldquo;learn&rdquo; to &ldquo;build things&rdquo; you could have done on your own.
You&rsquo;re learning a framework that won&rsquo;t be popular after a few years.
Teacher to student ratio is horrible and you won&rsquo;t get any one on one time.
Teachers are often students that graduated and hired to be TAs.
Everything is very put together and not organized, teachers have no experience teaching anybody at all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Github sent me a really neat virtual backpack with a bunch of fun goodies inside.</p>

<p>such as:</p>

<p>Atom — A hackable text editor for the 21st Century
Bitnami — Install cloud applications in a single click
Crowdflower — Crowdsourcing and data enrichment platform
DigitalOcean — Simple cloud hosting, built for developers
DNSimple — Simple DNS management with one-click services and a robust API
GitHub — Powerful collaboration, code review, and code management
HackHands — Live programming help available 24/7
Namecheap — Domain name registration and SSL certificates
Orchestrate — Unified search, time-series, geolocation, graph database and API
Screenhero — Screen sharing for collaboration in teams
SendGrid — Email infrastructure as a service
Stripe — Web and mobile payments, built for developers
Travis CI — Continuous integration platform for open source and private projects</p>

<p>The main thing I want to write about is Atom. Its github very own text editor and It is way more sleek
than sublime. It is also free so you don&rsquo;t have that annoying window popping up asking you to
purchase it. I will have to go into more detail about it later since I am still getting use to it but I have definately
gotten rid of sublime in favor over Atom.</p>

Unfortunately if you try to look for the instructions on how to do this on the Octopress website you are redirected to an error page.

  <div class="entry-content"><hr />

<p>In my quest to learn more about Linux and become more comfortable with the command line I installed Arch Linux. It&rsquo;s very minimal so I have to really think about what is necessary for development and install it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s great for development because everything is bleeding edge and updated manually.
It has yaourt which is the arch linux user repository and a lot of people contribute to it.
If I want the newest version of rails I can have it.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have to compile the newest version of Ruby I already have it.</p>

<p>I prefer it much more over Ubuntu because basically Ubuntu has become too commercial and doesn&rsquo;t help you learn anything. It also isn&rsquo;t really for someone who appreciates Linux.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wanted to deploy my rails blog on heroku but since heroku does not suppot sqlite3 I had to migrate to postgres
for my database.</p>

<p>it was pretty easy to do</p>

<p>I swapped out sqlite3 to pg in my gemfile and I also installed pg on my system to be able to run pg locally</p>

<p>on arch, installing is a breeze</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>pacman -S postgresql</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I then created a db as well as a user for my app.
create role myapp with createdb login password &lsquo;password1&rsquo;
then i added the info to my db.yml which should look like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>development:
</span><span class='line'>  adapter: postgresql
</span><span class='line'>  encoding: unicode
</span><span class='line'>  database: myapp_development
</span><span class='line'>  pool: 5
</span><span class='line'>  username: myapp
</span><span class='line'>  password: password1
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>test:
</span><span class='line'>  adapter: postgresql
</span><span class='line'>  encoding: unicode
</span><span class='line'>  database: myapp_test
</span><span class='line'>  pool: 5
</span><span class='line'>  username: myapp
</span><span class='line'>  password: password1</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>after setting my app up with pg everything worked fine until I deployed to heroku and then I ran into a problem with my apps routes not showing.</p>

<p>but this did the trick</p>

<p>heroku run rake db:migrate
heroku restart</p>
