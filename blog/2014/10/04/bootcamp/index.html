<p>I had my HackReactor interview today and I really felt like my student instructor did not explain things well. I also don&rsquo;t like that my admissions is based on an interview with a returning student. I felt like he could have told me to declare a function and have if it do some shit would have been better instructions.</p>

<p>first he wrote some psuedo code which kinda got me stuck on because I thought I was suppose to edit it. The variable he used and the one I was suppose to use was the same word so I didn&rsquo;t understand that he wanted me to create a whole new function. Once we were done I thought to myself that&rsquo;s all you wanted me to do?</p>

<p>The difference between writing a function and invoking a function
 Passing functions as arguments to other functions
 Iterating through an array or an object using a for or while loop
 Using if statements to let your code make decisions</p>

<p> This is what I was told to do in the e-mail and I can do all of these things.</p>
