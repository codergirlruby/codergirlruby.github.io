In my quest to learn more about Linux and become more comfortable with the command line I installed Arch Linux. It's very minimal so I have to really think about what is necessary for development and install it.


It's great for development because everything is bleeding edge and updated manually.
It has yaourt which is the arch linux user repository and a lot of people contribute to it. 
If I want the newest version of rails I can have it.
 
I don't have to compile the newest version of Ruby I already have it. 

I prefer it much more over Ubuntu because basically Ubuntu has become too commercial and doesn't help you learn anything. It also isn't really for someone who appreciates Linux.
