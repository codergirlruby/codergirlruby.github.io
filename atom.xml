    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had my HackReactor interview today and I really felt like my student instructor did not explain things well. I also don&rsquo;t like that my admissions is based on an interview with a returning student and not a trained instructor. I felt like he could have told me to declare a function and have if it do some shit would have been better instructions.</p>

<p>first he wrote some psuedo code which kinda got me stuck on because I thought I was suppose to edit it. The variable he used and the one I was suppose to use was the same word so I didn&rsquo;t understand that he wanted me to create a whole new function. Once we were done I thought to myself that&rsquo;s all you wanted me to do?</p>

<p>The difference between writing a function and invoking a function</p>

<p> Passing functions as arguments to other functions</p>

<p> Iterating through an array or an object using a for or while loop</p>

<p> Using if statements to let your code make decisions</p>

<p> This is what I was told to do in the e-mail and I can do all of these things. If Hack reactor is suppose to be so good at preparing you to become a software engineer why are students coming back to build their portfolio? I&rsquo;m actually glad it didn&rsquo;t work out because I am not  paying $17,000 to come back because I couldn&rsquo;t get a job.</p>

<p> I&rsquo;m inclined to believe the 99% hire rate is due to the students working at HackReactor. My interviewer couldn&rsquo;t even name a few companies who came to look at them. Just one and kinda brushed it off. I also read someone else&rsquo;s blog post where they were told 9 companies would show up to check the students out and only 3 showed up.</p>

<p> kinda seems like a pyramid scheme.</p>

<p> Interesting article <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3023456/become-an-ios-developer-in-8-weeks-the-truth-about-hack-schools">http://www.fastcompany.com/3023456/become-an-ios-developer-in-8-weeks-the-truth-about-hack-schools</a></p>

Unfortunately if you try to look for the instructions on how to do this on the Octopress website you are redirected to an error page.

<p>There&rsquo;s instructions for different ways in which you can edit the fiddle within your blog.</p>

    <id>http://codergirlruby.github.io/blog/2014/09/29/why-i-like-arch-linux</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<hr />

<p>In my quest to learn more about Linux and become more comfortable with the command line I installed Arch Linux. It&rsquo;s very minimal so I have to really think about what is necessary for development and install it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s great for development because everything is bleeding edge and updated manually.
It has yaourt which is the arch linux user repository and a lot of people contribute to it.
If I want the newest version of rails I can have it.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have to compile the newest version of Ruby I already have it.</p>

<p>I prefer it much more over Ubuntu because basically Ubuntu has become too commercial and doesn&rsquo;t help you learn anything. It also isn&rsquo;t really for someone who appreciates Linux.</p>

    <link href="http://codergirlruby.github.io/blog/2014/09/29/deploying-rails-app-to-heroku/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-29T12:00:51-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://codergirlruby.github.io/blog/2014/09/29/deploying-rails-app-to-heroku</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to deploy my rails blog on heroku but since heroku does not suppot sqlite3 I had to migrate to postgres
for my database.</p>

<p>it was pretty easy to do</p>

<p>I swapped out sqlite3 to pg in my gemfile and I also installed pg on my system to be able to run pg locally</p>

<p>on arch, installing is a breeze</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>pacman -S postgresql</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I then created a db as well as a user for my app.
create role myapp with createdb login password &lsquo;password1&rsquo;
then i added the info to my db.yml which should look like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>development:
</span><span class='line'>  adapter: postgresql
</span><span class='line'>  encoding: unicode
</span><span class='line'>  database: myapp_development
</span><span class='line'>  pool: 5
</span><span class='line'>  username: myapp
</span><span class='line'>  password: password1
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>test:
</span><span class='line'>  adapter: postgresql
</span><span class='line'>  encoding: unicode
</span><span class='line'>  database: myapp_test
</span><span class='line'>  pool: 5
</span><span class='line'>  username: myapp
</span><span class='line'>  password: password1</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>after setting my app up with pg everything worked fine until I deployed to heroku and then I ran into a problem with my apps routes not showing.</p>

<p>but this did the trick</p>

<p>heroku run rake db:migrate
heroku restart</p>
